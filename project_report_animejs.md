**Client:** GĒMU PRO (User)

**Date:** May 11, 2025

**1. Project Overview:**

The objective was to redesign the existing creative portfolio website for GĒMU PRO, with a strong emphasis on advanced animations using Anime.js and other modern animation libraries. The goal was to create a highly dynamic, visually rich, and immersive experience to showcase two games: "Slayers Duel: Stick Fight" and "Galaxy War," while preserving all existing game data and content.

**2. Process and Execution:**

*   **Information Gathering:** All game details, descriptions, features, and visual assets from the previous version were retained.
*   **Template & Core Structure:** The existing Next.js project structure was maintained.
*   **Redesign with Advanced Animations:**
    *   A new design concept was developed, focusing on a futuristic and dynamic aesthetic.
    *   Anime.js was integrated as the primary animation library for complex timeline-based animations and interactive effects.
    *   Key sections (Hero, Game Showcases, About, Contact) were reimagined with sophisticated animations, including:
        *   Letter-by-letter text reveals and staggered element appearances.
        *   Scroll-triggered animations for engaging content presentation.
        *   A preloader animation for a polished initial loading experience.
        *   Subtle particle effects in the hero section for added visual depth.
    *   The dark theme was enhanced with vibrant, glowing accents and fluid transitions.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `page.tsx` was significantly updated to incorporate Anime.js for various animations across all sections.
    *   CSS was refactored to work in conjunction with JavaScript-driven animations, removing previous CSS keyframe animations.
*   **Testing and Validation:** Conducted thorough testing to ensure:
    *   Animation smoothness and performance across different browsers.
    *   Visual impact and adherence to the new design concept.
    *   Responsiveness of the layout on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   Functionality of all interactive elements and links.

**3. Final Deliverables:**

*   A fully functional and responsive website featuring advanced animations, showcasing "Slayers Duel: Stick Fight" and "Galaxy War."
